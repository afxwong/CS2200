Question 1
----------

lea $ra, 1
br target

When we are at the lea instruction, the PC is pointing at the "br target" line.
Because I want to prevent infinite looping, I want to make sure that $ra
is pointing at the line below "br target". This is why I have an offset of 1.
Once the storing of $ra is done, the PC next intruction to be executed is "br target".
This is an unconditional branch that makes sure that we always branch to the address of the target label,
thus mimicing the behavior of JALR.
